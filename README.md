# AssemblyCalculator
This is assembly code to do both division and subtraction on the intel 8086 microprocessor.

This will only do operations on single character numbers
Single character numbers can be placed into a single part of the accumulator register therefore it was easier to complete.



**TODO**
Complete single digit addition and multiplication
Complete multiple digit calculation for all available operations
